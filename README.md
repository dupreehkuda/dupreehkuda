### Hi, Iâ€™m Danila

I'm interested in making the world a better place.
I want to make a service/app/whatever to help people in their lifes.

I'm also looking for a job as a **Intern Developer**. I love learning new stuff.

Currently I'm learning `Go` and its most used frameworks and libraries. I can make an iOS app with `Swift` and `SwiftUI`. And I have common knowledge of `Python`, `C++`, `JavaScript`, `SQL`, `zsh`, machine learning, architectural patterns and data structures.
